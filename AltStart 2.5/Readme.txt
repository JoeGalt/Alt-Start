AltStart v. 2.5

This is a submod for X-piratez to allow for alternative starting troops to the standard six lunatics. This submod adds 18 Wooden Apples to the starting inventory, 
and new manufacturing options to use these apples to recruit any of the following. Each will have the Escaped Lunatic commendation.

3 Wooden Apples:
-Hero
-Girl Guide (with durasuit)
-Theban Assault Catgirl
-Freak

2 Wooden Apples:
-Assault Clone (with aqua suit)
-Wild Gnome
-Disciple of Twilight (Bugeye with Thin Man armor)
-Red Dawn Theurge (Damsel with Nun outfit)
-Ogre
-Former Commando

1 Wooden Apple:
-Catgirl
-Damsel
-Bloodhound
-Lokk'Naar

When recruiting gnomes or catgirls this way, a new item will also be produced (Guide to Gnomes/Catgirls) which when researched provides the Soldier: Gnome/Catgirl tech. 
The purpose of this is to allow for some armors to be researched for these troops in a reasonable time, as it is very possible not to reach this for these units for a very long time 
in normal play.

Note that each manufactured trooper will have a transfer time of 24 hours (hardcoded, I cannot change this), so you may need to use your lunatics for a mission or two 
before they arrive. After your alternate troops arrive you will need to dismiss your lunatics. 

I also recommend hiding the Wooden Apple manufacturing options after you have used them, or disable the submod.
